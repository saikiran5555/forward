    "Forward propagation in a neural network serves the purpose of computing the output of the network given certain input data. It involves passing the input data through the network's layers, applying the learned weights and biases to each neuron, and producing an output prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main purposes of forward propagation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction: Forward propagation allows the neural network to make predictions on new, unseen data. By passing input features through the network's layers and applying the learned parameters (weights and biases), the network produces an output that represents its prediction for the given input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Representation: As data passes through each layer of the neural network, it undergoes transformations that result in higher-level representations of the input features. Each layer extracts features from the input data, potentially leading to more abstract and useful representations in deeper layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation: Forward propagation is also used during the training process to evaluate the performance of the neural network on a particular dataset. By comparing the network's output with the true labels or targets, the loss or error can be calculated, which is then used to update the network's parameters during the backpropagation step."
