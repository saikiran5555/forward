    "The purpose of applying a softmax function in the output layer during forward propagation in a neural network is primarily to convert the raw output scores (often referred to as logits) into probabilities. This is particularly useful in multi-class classification tasks where the network needs to predict the probability of each class being the correct one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key reasons for using a softmax function in the output layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Distribution: The softmax function takes a vector of raw scores (logits) as input and normalizes them into a probability distribution. Each element of the output vector represents the probability of the corresponding class being the correct one. The probabilities are non-negative and sum up to 1, making them interpretable as probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretability: By converting raw scores into probabilities, the softmax function provides a clear interpretation of the model's confidence in each class prediction. This is especially important in classification tasks where understanding the certainty of predictions is valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiability: Softmax function is differentiable, which is essential for training neural networks using gradient-based optimization algorithms like backpropagation. During backpropagation, the gradients of the loss function with respect to the output of the softmax function can be computed efficiently, allowing the network to learn and update its parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Entropy Loss: Softmax function is often combined with the cross-entropy loss function, which is commonly used as the loss function for multi-class classification problems. The cross-entropy loss measures the difference between the predicted probability distribution (output of the softmax function) and the true distribution of class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stability: Softmax function helps stabilize the outputs of the neural network by preventing large values from exploding during the exponentiation process. It does this by exponentiating each input value and then normalizing by the sum of the exponentiated values."
